# ETL UseCase Using Python:

## Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement an end-to-end Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process for a bicycle store using Python. The ETL pipeline will handle data from various sources including databases, data lakes, and APIs, and will involve data extraction, data quality checks, transformations, and loading into a structured data model for analysis capabilities for stakeholders.

## Features

- Extraction from various data sources
- Data quality checks and cleansing
- Transformations and data modeling
- Visualization of insights

## Project Structure

The project is meticulously organized into several directories, each serving a distinct purpose:

- Extraction: Contains scripts and notebooks for extracting data from various sources.
- Data Quality Checks: Notebooks dedicated to performing data quality assessments on the extracted data.
- Transformation: Notebooks for executing data transformations as per project requirements.
- Modeling: Notebooks for modeling the data and generating visualizations.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies: 

- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib

- seaborn
